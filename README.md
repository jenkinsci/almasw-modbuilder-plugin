## ALMASW

Basically ALMASW is a set of software modules to control the [ALMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array) telescope instruments and manage the data produced by the telescope. These modules are built on top of ACS, a LGPL software framework/infrastructure which provides common CORBA-based services such as logging, error and alarm management, configuration database and lifecycle management in a container-model fashion.
